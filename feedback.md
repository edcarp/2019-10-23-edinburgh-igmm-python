# Feedback - 23rd October 19

## Python feedback

### The good

* Good range of topics covered, comprehensive notes.
* Really good course! The examples were really good, particularly the debugging exercise. It was really well paced; not to fast/slow.
* All good =)
* Great. Very helpful for beginners :) I like the post-it notes idea.
* Good speed.
* The course was really well structured, well tought and having several people on hand to help was really good.
* Good pace. Section on understanding and correcting errors great.
* Explanations were clear and easy to follow.
* Well explained. Better than last Python course I attended. Really good to be able to play with code. Friendly tutor. Good to answer questions by coding live on board.
* Good way to learn the basics of Python - very informative.
* Very intense, handy and useful. I can perform data analysis using Python right away.
* Well-organised course that was really calm and chilled. Found the lesson guide really helpful!

### The bad

* It would be helpful to get an explanation what different elements (?) e.g. string, list, integer, etc. are in the beginning of the course.
* More independent exercises.
* Bit fast-paced for complete beginner - perhaps more an advertising issue.
* More biological examples would have been good (i.e. handling biological datasets).
* Was not sure about what was needing doing / propose of error to fix it.
* Think more exercises with more time to do them would be useful. Especially for what was done towards the end of the day.
* Would have liked to play around with graph/figure drawing more - just because that is more relevant for me!
* Nothing.
